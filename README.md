<H3>Project Description:</H3>
Surveyor can create a survey with a list of Questions. Questions can be open-ended (text), asking for a number within a range, or asking to choose among many options.  Users fill out a survey that is a form generated based on the type of questions in the survey. Surveyor can close the survey whenever they want (thus not letting in new users to fill out the survey), and at that point a survey result is generated, compiling the answers: for open-ended questions, the answers are just listed as-is, for number questions a histogram of the answers is generated, for choice questions a pie chart is generated
